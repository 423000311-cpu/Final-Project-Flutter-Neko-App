# Neko-App 
In many schools, workplaces, and public areas, lost items are difficult to track and return to their rightful owners. Traditional methods—such as using physical logbooks, bulletin boards, or verbal announcements—often lead to misplaced records, delays, and unclaimed items. A dedicated Lost and Found Management System can simplify the process by organizing item reports, categorizing found objects, and helping users quickly check whether their missing belongings have been submitted. This project aims to introduce a simple and systematic platform to assist individuals in reporting, tracking, and claiming lost items.
